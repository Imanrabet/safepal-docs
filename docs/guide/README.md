Although blockchain promises to cut out the middleman and boost security, crypto still has its gatekeepers: Long learning curves and clunky, expensive tools. Throw in the risk of getting hacked, and it's no wonder most people stick to fiat.

In 2018, Veronica Wong, a veteran in the tech industry, founded SafePal with two co-founders who shared her mission. Initially a hardware wallet, SafePal has since evolved to a complete suite of smart, secure crypto management solutions accessible for tech pros and non-geeks alike.

In only a handful of years, we've garnered the support of industry giants like Binance and risen from a humble (but ambitious) startup to a global enterprise bringing the freedom and power of crypto to millions â€“ and we're just getting started.
